MiniChallengeEightToTen-Endpoints
Creating 3 Controllers, 2 with one endpoint (Eight Ball & Restaurant Picker), and 1 with 3 enpoints (Guess It). Each Endpoint requires an input, and will output something depending on the endpoint's purpose. I used basic random classes, arrays, and if statements to achieve everything.

Eight Ball, Guess its, and Restauraunt Picker function perfectly! Tested on both Swagger and Postman.
Not sure if the Eight Ball really needs an input but its a nice touch
